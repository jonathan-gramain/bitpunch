## BitPunch schema syntax

BitPunch schemas define the structure of binary file formats.

Examples can be found for now in the various schema files in
[resources/bp](../resources/bp/) and [examples](../examples/) directories.

TODO: describe grammar using a rigorous notation like BNF, once the
syntax becomes more or less stable.
